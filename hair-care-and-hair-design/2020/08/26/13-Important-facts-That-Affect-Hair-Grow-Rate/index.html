				<p>Generally, hair grows about half an inch per month. However, there are a wide variety of factors that can affect <b>hair growth.</b> Knowing these factors, we can have the most control to maximize the rate of hair growth.</p>

<p>Years. In general, the incidence of hair loss in men and women corresponds to chronological age. The older you get, the more likely you are to lose your hair. People generally experience slower growth as they age.</p>

<p>Weather. They say our locks grow faster in hot weather. On the other hand, the sun can damage the scalp and hair. Therefore, it is recommended that you protect your locks from UVA and UVB rays with a hat or sunscreen, especially in the summer months. Cold can also affect growth. Cold air can cause hair to become dry, brittle, and more brittle.</p>

<p>Diet. The growth rate also depends on the health of the scalp and follicles. To ensure <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3evrBnl">faster hair growth</a>, your diet should include fresh fruits and vegetables. Good nutrition means the best possible conditions for building strong and glowing castles.</p>

<p>Vitamins and minerals. The B vitamins are especially helpful for healthier hair growth. The important minerals are iron, zinc, iodine and silica.
<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3evrBnl"><img alt="Grow your hair easily" src="../../../../../assets/img/Hair-Growth-Secrets-1-250-323.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Rest and sleep. Adequate rest is important for the body and even for our hair. Lack of sleep can negatively affect various physical processes, including hair growth. Rest when you are tired and try to get at least 7 hours of sleep a day.</p>

<p>Exercise. When you exercise, your general health improves. It also increases blood flow to the scalp for better oxygenation and better distribution of nutrients.</p>

<p>Stress. Learn to manage stress, as it is one of the most common causes of sudden hair loss. When youâ€™re under pressure, more follicles are placed in the resting phase of the hair cycle.</p>

<p>The genes. Genetic factors are not only responsible for hair color, but also for density, texture, and growth. In people genetically prone to hair loss, DHT or dihydrotestosterone initiates the miniaturization of hair follicles. Over time, your hair becomes thinner and the overall volume of your hair decreases. Eventually, the hair follicle can stop producing hair altogether.

<p>Hormones Certain hormones can affect <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3evrBnl"><b>hair growth.</b></a> These include thyroid hormone, estrogen, and testosterone. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause hair loss. The female hormone estrogen increases the number of follicles in the hair growth cycle, as seen during pregnancy. After giving birth, the level of this hormone drops and hair begins to fall out. Testosterone, a male hormone, combines with 5AR or 5 alpha reductase to form DHT. DHT has been identified as the leading cause of baldness in both men and women.</p>

<p>Health problems. Various diseases such as thyroid problems, scalp infections, lupus, lichen planus, and alopecia areata can negatively affect the overall condition of the hair.</p>

<p>Condition of the hair and scalp. There are a number of factors that can slow hair growth. These are ringworm infection, folliculitis or inflammation of the hair follicles, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. Dry hair is prone to breakage and hair loss.</p>

<p>Lifestyle. Various lifestyle factors can affect <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3evrBnl">hair growth.</a> Smoking has been linked to baldness and premature graying of hair. Living healthier and taking everything in moderation is important to promoting a healthy body and healthy curls.</p>

<p>Hair products. When choosing a shampoo, opt for a blend of organic herbs that promotes and maximizes healthy hair growth.
To ensure healthy hair and faster growth, caring for your hair should be part of your daily routine.</p>
